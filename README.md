# Article-Summarization-and-Title-Generation

This project automatically generates short, meaningful summaries and titles from lengthy news articles using a hybrid NLP approach that combines extractive (TF-IDF + TextRank) and abstractive (T5 Transformer) methods. Built using the BBC News Summary dataset from Kaggle, the system identifies key information, generates human-like titles, and evaluates performance using ROUGE, BLEU, and Cosine Similarity metrics. It helps in creating concise, accurate, and context-aware news summaries efficiently.
